/*Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.*/

//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
//Passing version
let alien_color='green';

    if ( alien_color  == 'green'){
        console.log("The Player earned just 5 Points");
    }
//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)


//Failing version
let alien_color1="red"

    if ( alien_color1  == 'green'){
        console.log("The Player earned just 5 Points");
       }
       else{
